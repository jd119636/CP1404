+## Summary
+
+Hello my name is Indra Kiiver I am a 19 year old Engineering student studying at JCU
+here are my 3 things I have learned about clean code in this subject:
+
+- clean code should good commit messages so that you know what has been updated
+- clean code should be separated by empty lines to be able to be read, (ctrl alt l) automatically refactors the code
+- lastly clean code should have good function names
+
+here you can access the practicalls and their information aswell as programing patterns:
